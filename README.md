Installation:
The content is available over the internet and does not require installation of any sort.

Usage:
This planner is designed to keep track of daily tasks between the hours of 7am and 10pm.


Upon loading, the user will see blocks for each hour between 7am and 10pm.
Each will be colored as follows:
Grey:Past
Green:Current
Red:Future

To use, click within the colored block of the hour in which a task is required. Enter text as prompted, then click the blue save icon to the right of the designated block.

Now the task is saved! It will hold its place even after the page is reloaded from the same system.
